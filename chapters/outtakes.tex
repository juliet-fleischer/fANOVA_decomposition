\subsubsection*{Analytical Example Functions for fANOVA}

We present a selection of analytically tractable functions that highlight different behaviors of the fANOVA decomposition.

\paragraph{Sparse additive + interaction (low effective dimensionality).}
These functions illustrate cases where only a few variables or low-order interactions dominate the variance, allowing fANOVA to compress the functional complexity:
\[
f_1(x) = x_1 + x_2 \cdot x_3
\]


\paragraph{Smooth localized function.}
This function is smooth but has variance concentrated in a small region of the input space. It can be used to explore how fANOVA captures global variance, not localized effects:
\[
f_3(x, y) = \exp\left(-100(x^2 + y^2)\right)
\]
Each of these functions can be used to stress-test specific characteristics of the fANOVA decomposition: sparsity, interaction order, locality, and smoothness.

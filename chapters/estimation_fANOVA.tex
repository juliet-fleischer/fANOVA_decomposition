In this chapter we will illustrate two approaches to estimate the fANOVA components on a conceptual level. The first approach can be found in \cite{hooker2007} and is essentially a linear least squares problem. The second approach uses Fourier polynomial expansion and is proposed by \cite{rahman2014}.

The related literature on fANOVA can be grouped into several thematic clusters. Each highlights a different angle on why fANOVA has proven useful and points to why a unified presentation is needed.\par

The underlying principle of the hierarchical, additive decomposition of a function dates back to \cite{hoeffding1948}. In his seminal work on U-statistics, he introduced the Hoeffding decomposition.
Though originally framed around estimators, this decomposition laid the groundwork for fANOVA by showing how a symmetric function can be written as a sum of orthogonal components of increasing dimensionality.
Independently, \cite{sobol1993sensitivity} proved that any square integrable function on the unit hypercube can be decomposed into a sum of orthogonal components. He originally called it ``decomposition into summands of different dimension'' and later renames it ``ANOVA-representation'' \citep{sobol2001} now referred to as the fANOVA decomposition.
The foundational work on fANOVA shows, that it is rooted in rigorous mathematical theory, and provides a principled way to break down complex multivariate functions into interpretable, orthogonal parts.\par

A second strand of work explores how fANOVA underlies non‑parametric modeling approaches.
\cite{takemura1983} introduced tensor‑analysis of ANOVA decompositions, laying the theoretical foundation. \cite{stone1994} applied fANOVA ideas to polynomial splines and generalized additive models. \cite{gu2013} extended this into smoothing‑spline ANOVA frameworks for flexible regression estimation. fANOVA not only provides a theoretical decomposition—but also serves as a basis for widely-used non‑parametric statistical models featuring additive structure and controlled interactions.\par

Perhaps the most well-known application of fANOVA is in variance‑based sensitivity analysis. Sobol’s original decomposition led directly to variance partitioning and interpretation via Sobol indices. 
Work from \cite{owen2013, owen2014} modernized this framework, introducing efficient estimation strategies and generalized indices suited to quasi‑Monte Carlo methods. \cite{borgonovo2022} further advanced the field with mixture‑based generalizations of fANOVA for uncertainty quantification.\par

Classical fANOVA requires independent input variables, which is a strong assumption in many real‑world applications. Therefore, a stream of literature is concerned with the generalization of fANOVA to dependent variables. WWhile \cite{hooker2007} was the first to present a generalized fANOVA framework, many other researchers were inspired by his work to create modifications of this \cite{rahman2014,chastaing2012,ilidrissi2025}.
We see the generalization as central part of the basis of the fANOVA decomposition and therefore will also present it in this thesis.\par

A vibrant recent cluster of literature studies fANOVA for model interpretability. There is work of \cite{lengerich2020, konig2024, choi2025} that all enhance interpretability by using fANOVA to identify and disentangle variable interactions.
Then there is work done in the explicit context of interpretable ML. Here fANOVA can be used as a model-agnostic tool \cite{hooker2004,fumagalli2025} are relevant or as foundational principle to build inherently interpretable models \cite{hu2025}. TThis is probably the most recent field of fANOVA in which research is actively ongoing.\par

Finally, there are specific domains of statistics, such as geostatistics, that explicitly build models on fANOVA framework (see \cite{muehlenstaedt2012} for fANOVA Kriging models) or use it to study functions arising in computational finance \cite{liu2006}.\par

\begin{frame}{Classical fANOVA Proofs}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Zero mean property: factorized density, Fubinis Theorem, strong annihilating conditions
        \item Mutual orthogonality: factorized density, Fubinis Theorem, strong annihilating conditions
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Generalized fANOVA Proofs}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Zero mean property: separating $x$ into subvectors, marginal density, Fubinis Theorem, weak annihilating conditions
        \item Hierarchical orthogonality: set the scene, u is a proper subset of v $u \subsetneq v$, so there is an index in u which is not in v; divide $x_u$ into subvectors, marginal density, Fubini and weak annihilating conditions
        \item Weak annihilating becomes strong under independence: assume the weak ones, product density, factor out
        \item Three integration cases: distinguish between different relationships u and v, depending on the relationship the integral w.r.t. to marginal density simplifies
        \item Generalized fANOVA components by Rahman: first build constant term; for nonconstant terms use integration cases
        \item Integration constraint Hooker: show that hierarchical orthogonality is fulfilled if the conditions hold, show that it is not fulfilled if they do not hold; but why exactly these conditions a bit unclear
        \item Take a look at Sobols proof again

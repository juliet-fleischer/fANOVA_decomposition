  abstract = {This paper introduces generalized Sobol' indices, compares strategies for their estimation, and makes a systematic search for efficient estimators. Of particular interest are contrasts, sums of squares, and indices of bilinear form which allow a reduced number of function evaluations compared to alternatives. The bilinear framework includes some efficient estimators from Saltelli [Comput. Phys. Comm., 145 (2002), pp. 280--297] and Mauntz [Global Sensitivity Analysis of General Nonlinear Systems, Master's thesis, Imperial College, London, 2002] as well as some new estimators for specific variance components and mean dimensions. This paper also provides a bias corrected version of the estimator of Janon et al. [Asymptotic Normality and Efficiency of Two Sobol' Index Estimators, technical report, INRIA, Rocquencourt, France] and extends the bias correction to generalized Sobol' indices. Some numerical comparisons are given.},

  abstract={The Functional ANOVA model is considered in the context of generalized regression, which includes logistic regression, probit regression, and Poisson regression as special cases. The multivariate predictor function is modeled as a specified sum of a constant term, main effects, and selected interaction terms. Maximum likelihood estimate is used, where the maximization is taken over a suitably chosen approximating space. The approximating space is constructed from virtually arbitrary linear spaces of functions and their tensor products and is compatible with the assumed ANOVA structure on the predictor function. Under mild conditions, the maximum likelihood estimate is consistent and the components of the estimate in an appropriately defined ANOVA decomposition are consistent in estimating the corresponding components of the predictor function. When the predictor function does not satisfy the assumed ANOVA form, the estimate converges to its best approximation of that form relative to the expected log-likelihood. A rate of convergence result is obtained, which reinforces the intuition that low-order ANOVA modeling can achieve dimension reduction and thus overcome the curse of dimensionality.},

Under boundedness type assumptions on the joint density function of the input variables, we show that a generalized Hoeffding-Sobol decomposition is available. This leads to new indices measuring the sensitivity of the output with respect to the input variables. We also study and discuss the estimation of these new indices.},

    abstract = { This article explores the generalized analysis-of-variance, or ANOVA, dimensional decomposition (ADD) for multivariate functions of dependent random variables. Two notable properties, stemming from weakened annihilating conditions, reveal that the component functions of the generalized ADD have zero means and are hierarchically orthogonal. By exploiting these properties, a simple alternative approach is presented to derive a coupled system of equations that the generalized ADD component functions satisfy. The coupled equations, which subsume as a special case the classical ADD, reproduce the component functions for independent probability measures. To determine the component functions of the generalized ADD, a new constructive method is proposed by employing measure-consistent, multivariate orthogonal polynomials as bases and calculating the expansion coefficients involved from the solution of linear algebraic equations. New generalized formulae are presented for the second-moment characteristics, including triplets of global sensitivity indices, for dependent probability distributions. Furthermore, the generalized ADD leads to extended definitions of effective dimensions, reported in the current literature for the classical ADD. Numerical results demonstrate that the correlation structure of random variables can significantly alter the composition of component functions, producing widely varying global sensitivity indices and, therefore, distinct rankings of random variables. An application to random eigenvalue analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approximation. }

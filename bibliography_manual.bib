  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a regression model built on dependent variables. This regression modelizes an input output relationship. Under boundedness type assumptions on the joint density function of the input variables, we show that a generalized Hoeffding-Sobol decomposition is available. This leads to new indices measuring the sensitivity of the output with respect to the input variables. We also study and discuss the estimation of these new indices.},

    abstract = { This article explores the generalized analysis-of-variance, or ANOVA, dimensional decomposition (ADD) for multivariate functions of dependent random variables. Two notable properties, stemming from weakened annihilating conditions, reveal that the component functions of the generalized ADD have zero means and are hierarchically orthogonal. By exploiting these properties, a simple alternative approach is presented to derive a coupled system of equations that the generalized ADD component functions satisfy. The coupled equations, which subsume as a special case the classical ADD, reproduce the component functions for independent probability measures. To determine the component functions of the generalized ADD, a new constructive method is proposed by employing measure-consistent, multivariate orthogonal polynomials as bases and calculating the expansion coefficients involved from the solution of linear algebraic equations. New generalized formulae are presented for the second-moment characteristics, including triplets of global sensitivity indices, for dependent probability distributions. Furthermore, the generalized ADD leads to extended definitions of effective dimensions, reported in the current literature for the classical ADD. Numerical results demonstrate that the correlation structure of random variables can significantly alter the composition of component functions, producing widely varying global sensitivity indices and, therefore, distinct rankings of random variables. An application to random eigenvalue analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed approximation. }
